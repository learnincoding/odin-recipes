           <p class="hate">Hate Squash? So do I. I don't hate this recipe and you know your mother in law is going to bring some squash over this fall from her garden.</p>

            <p class="hate">You didn't give the lady grandkids so the least you can do is use her squash.</p>

            <p class="ingredients">Ingredients</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li class="spoon">1 small spaghetti squash, halved and seeded</li>
                        <li class="spoon" >2 ½ tablespoons butter</li>
                        <li class="spoon">½ tablespoon chopped fresh chervil</li>

                        <li class="spoon">½ tablespoon chopped fresh sage</li>
                        <li class="spoon">½ tablespoon chopped fresh chives</li>
                        <li class="spoon" >½ tablespoon chopped fresh chives</li>
                        <li class="spoon" >½ tablespoon chopped fresh chives</li>
                        <li class="spoon">½ teaspoon salt</li>

            <p class="steps">Steps</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                        <li>Place spaghetti squash halves cut-sides down in a baking dish and add enough water to come 1/2-inch up the sides of the baking dish. Cover with aluminum foil.</li>
                        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the squash can easily be pierced with a sharp knife, about 45 minutes. Turn squash over, cover with foil again, and continue to cook until the squash is very tender, about 15 more minutes. Remove from the oven, uncover, and allow to cool slightly. Using a fork, gently pull the strands of squash away from the peel and place into a bowl.</li>
                        <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add spaghetti squash strands, chervil, basil, parsley, sage, chives, salt, and pepper and cook until flavors are combined and heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>

                    </ol>
